## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

* Adjusting prices in suburban and rural areas so the average fire per rider isn't less than the average fare per driver. This tells me that Ride Share is losing moeny on Suburban and Urban drives. 
* Increase drivers in rural and suurban areas as the cost per fare is higher which means margins could be greater. 
* Look into dips and peaks that occured from Janurary through April. The last weekend in february showed an increase in all 3 city types.
* Even out the distribution of rural/suburban/urban once making each profitable to help balance city types and not put all eggs in once balance. Urban also seems to fluctuate the most on total fares each week.
