# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create an analysis of ride sharing by city type using python, pandas, and matplotlib. We cut the data from January to April and segmented by week. Then we were able to show total weekly fares by each city type, graph the results, analyze trends week over week and provide recommendations. 
## Results

**Total Rides**
* Urban rides had the most rides out of all city groups with over 68% of all rides. Suburban had the second highest of total rides with 26% percent. Rural had the fewest total rides with only 5% of all rides.

**Total Drivers**
* Urban drivers were 81% of all drivers with over 2,400 drivers. Suburban was next with 490 drivers with 16% of driver share. Lastly, rural had the smallest amount of total drivers with only 4% of total drive share. 

**Total Fares**
* Like total rides and total fares, urban held the majority of total fares amount with 62% amount of all total fares. Suburban was next with 30% of total fares. Lastly rural was last with 6% of total fares. 

**Average Fare per Ride**
* Lowest average fare per ride is urban with 24.53. This is most likely due to shorter rides, being it in a more of a city type setting. Suburban was next with an average fare per ride $30.97. Lastly, rural had the highest average fare per ride of $34.62 due to longer ride lengths.

**Average fare per driver**
* Lowest average fare per driver is urban with $16.57.  In an urban setting, drivers are doing shorter but more frequent drives. Next suburban average fare per driver was $39.50. Lastly, the highest average fare per driver in rural was $55.49. Most likely rural had teh highest fare per driver due to less drivers in rural areas and longer rides. 

**Total Fare by City Type**
* The total fares overall were $63,537 from January to April. Urban held the largest share of this with over 62% of total fare share. Suburban was next with 30% of total fare percentage. Lastly, urban held 6% of total fare share. Majority of business comes from the suburban and urban rides.

## Summary
A few business recommendations I would make to Pyber regarding the results above:
* Adjusting prices in suburban and rural areas so the average fare per rider isn't less than the average fare per driver. This tells me that Pyber is losing money on suburban and urban rides or does not have enough drivers for suburban or urban rides. 
* Increase drivers in rural and suburban areas as the cost per fare is higher than urban, which means margins could be greater on longer rides. 
* Deep dive into dips and peaks that occured from Janurary through April to look at trends. For example the last weekend in February showed an increase in all 3 city types. 
* Even out the distribution of rural/suburban/urban making each city type profitable to help balance profit. Urban also seems to fluctuate the most on total fares each week. With urban being the top contributer on total fare amounts but also the most volatile, I'd want suburban and rural to bigger share on profit.
